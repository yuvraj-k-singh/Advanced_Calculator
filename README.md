# RiseX Advanced Calculator
RiseX Advanced Calculator built in C programming. A menu-driven calculator that performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, LCM, HCF, Factorial, Square, Cube, Power, Odd/Even, and Prime checks. Features input validation, modular functions, and a user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates the use of core C programming concepts such as **loops, if-else conditions, functions, switch-case, and operators**. It is designed with modularity, input validation, and a user-friendly interface.
